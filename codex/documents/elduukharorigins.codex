    "A recent encounter in the far reaches of space has lead to the discovery of a new race of dragon-like beings. They call themselves the Eld'uukhar, and they look remarkably like the dragons of old fantasy writers told about in the ancient history of Earth. It's quite remarkable.",
	
	"There scales are soft, but provide a good amount of armour for combat, and it is worthy to note that their stomachs are made up of larger, more plate-like formations of these scales. This seems, however, to make them more vunerable to attacks in this area, as the larger plates have more noticeable gaps whereby an assailant could reach the skin underneath with a weapon, claws or teeth.",
	
	"These beings have immense skill in crafting with crystals and metal. In stereotypical fantasy fashion, some even go as far as to hoard particularly the crystals. After conversing with one subject, I found that their home planet is rich in these minerals, and that they often hold useful properties, making them perfect for fuel and other technological applications.",
